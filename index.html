            <img width="500" src="images/myphoto.jpeg" alt="myphoto">
            <p>Hi, my name is Brinto and I'm from Kerala,India. I'm currently pursuing my studies in Canada in Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. I like to try out new experiences and am always keen to learn how different things work. I love trying out different foods but I hate cooking.</p>
            <p>During my freetime I like to watch sports especially football but am bad at playing football. The only sport am kind of good at playing is badminton.I also like to watch movies although I don't really get time to watch them. I love pets especially dogs. I like to go on hikes because of all the beautiful nature views.</p>
            <q>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q><em>- Albert Einstein</em>
